# web_scraping_justwatch_project
JustWatch is a popular platform that allows users to search for movies and TV shows across multiple streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. For this assignment, you will be required to scrape movie and TV show data from JustWatch using Selenium, Python, and BeautifulSoup. Extract data from HTML, not by directly calling their APIs. Then, perform data filtering and analysis using Pandas, and finally, save the results to a CSV file.
